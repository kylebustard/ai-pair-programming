   - Create an admin interface
   - Add markdown support
   - Implement image handling

3. **Performance (1 hour)**
   - Add caching
   - Optimize images
   - Implement loading states

### Tips for Success

- Focus on understanding the patterns
- Ask AI to explain tradeoffs in different approaches
- Use AI to learn about performance optimization

## Level 4: Advanced Features (4-5 hours) üöÄ

### What You'll Build

Add authentication and user-specific content.

### Steps

1. **Auth Setup (1 hour)**

   - Implement Supabase Auth
   - Create protected routes
   - Add user profiles

2. **User Features (2 hours)**

   - Add commenting system
   - Implement likes/bookmarks
   - Create user dashboards

3. **Polish (1 hour)**
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance mobile experience

### Tips for Success

- Use AI to understand security implications
- Ask about best practices for user experience
- Learn about state management patterns

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration ü§ù

1. **Clear Communication**

   - Be specific about what you want
   - Provide context about your project
   - Ask for explanations when needed

2. **Iterative Development**

   - Start simple, then add complexity
   - Test frequently
   - Commit code in small chunks

3. **Learning Focus**

   - Ask AI to explain its suggestions
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Learn from error messages

4. **Code Quality**
   - Ask AI about best practices
   - Request code reviews
   - Learn about testing patterns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Don't**

   - Accept code without understanding it
   - Skip error handling
   - Ignore type safety
   - Copy-paste without context

2. **Do**
   - Break tasks into small steps
   - Verify security considerations
   - Test edge cases
   - Document your learnings

## Next Steps üìö

1. **Expand Your Skills**

   - Try different AI coding tools
