# Cursor vs Windsurf IDE Development Cheatsheet

## Foundation

Both Cursor and Windsurf are built on top of Visual Studio Code, making them familiar to VS Code users while adding AI-powered features to enhance the development experience.

## Context Management and Memory Features

### Cursor Context Management

- **Manual Context Addition**: Typically requires manually adding files to context with commands like `@file`, `@codebase`, or `@files`
- **Model Domain Context (MDC)**: Uses `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directory to provide persistent project context
- **Cursor Rules**: Configuration files that define how AI should interact with your codebase
- **Context Tagging**: Tag specific parts of the codebase for AI reference

### Windsurf Context Management

- **Automatic Context Analysis**: Automatically indexes codebase to find relevant files
- **Memory Feature**: Can generate and store "memories" to retain context between conversations
- **Context Pinning**: Pin specific contexts for future reference
- **Context Tagging**: Tag and reference specific contexts

## High-Level Concepts

## Workflow Differences

### Cursor Workflow

1. Open project in Cursor IDE
2. Set up MDC rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory for project context
3. Manually add relevant files to context (often) using `@file` or `@codebase`
4. Use Composer to generate or modify code
5. Apply changes to codebase
6. Debug using integrated tools
7. Consider creating new MDC rules to capture learned context

### Windsurf Workflow

1. Open project in Windsurf or use Windsurf plugin in your preferred IDE
2. Let Cascade automatically analyze the codebase
3. Toggle between "Write" and "Chat" modes as needed
4. Leverage step-by-step guided workflow for changes
5. See changes with clear visual diffs
6. Use automatic memory generation to maintain context
7. Access saved memories from the Memories Panel

## Best Practices

### For Cursor

1. Be explicit about context by selecting relevant files
2. Use composer for complex tasks spanning multiple files
3. Leverage web search for up-to-date library documentation
4. Use agent mode for automated context filling
5. Create structured MDC rule files in `.cursor/rules/` directory
6. Use naming conventions for MDC files (e.g., `NNN_name.mdc` format)
7. Restart Cursor after making changes to MDC rules for them to take effect

### For Windsurf

1. Trust the automatic context filling but verify when needed
2. Use "Write" mode for code generation and "Chat" mode for explanations
3. Take advantage of the step-by-step visualization for complex changes
4. Consider using Codeium extension in other IDEs for flexibility
5. Leverage automatic memory generation for maintaining context
6. Use `@web` for web searches when needed
7. Try the URL input feature to use web content as context

## Context and Memory Comparison

### Cursor's MDC System

- Uses `.mdc` files stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Provides persistent project context and code conventions
- Requires manual creation and maintenance
- Supports various rule structures with filters and actions
- Rules can be organized by naming conventions (e.g., `NNN_name.mdc`)
- Changes to rules require IDE restart to take effect
- Great for projects with well-defined standards and patterns

### Windsurf's Memory System

- Automatically generates "memories" to retain context between conversations
- Memories are accessible through a dedicated Memories Panel
- Can prompt Cascade to create a memory at any time
- More dynamic and user-friendly approach to context management
- Integrates terminal commands as context for Cascade
- Provides web search capabilities via `@web` command
- Ideal for developers who prefer automatic context handling

## Which One Should You Choose?

- **Choose Cursor if:**

  - You need fine-grained control over context through rules
  - You're working on complex, production-ready applications
  - You want to define explicit project standards through MDC rules
  - You prefer a comprehensive debugging experience
  - You're willing to invest time in setting up detailed context rules

- **Choose Windsurf if:**
  - You want a cleaner, more intuitive UI
  - You prefer automatic context and memory handling
  - You need flexibility across different IDEs
  - You're a beginner or value guided workflows
  - You appreciate the clear separation between chat and code writing modes
  - You're on a tighter budget

Both tools use similar AI models under the hood, so the choice primarily depends on your workflow preferences, UI expectations, and how you prefer to manage context in your development process.
