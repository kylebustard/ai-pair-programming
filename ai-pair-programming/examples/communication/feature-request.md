# Feature Request: User Profile Image Upload

## Goal

Add the ability for users to upload and update their profile images directly from the UserProfile component.

## Context

### Current Functionality

- Users can view and edit text-based profile information
- Profile images are currently display-only
- Images are stored in S3 but no direct upload capability exists

### Related Components

- `UserProfile.tsx`: Main profile component
- `ProfileForm.tsx`: Form handling component
- `ImageDisplay.tsx`: Image rendering component

### Business Rules

- Max image size: 5MB
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG
- Images must be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Auto-crop/resize on upload

## Constraints

### Performance

- Upload progress indication required
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Client-side image processing for size/format

### Security

- Authenticated uploads only
- File type validation
- Virus scanning integration
- Secure URL generation

### Compatibility

- Mobile-first design
- Touch-friendly interface
- Fallback for older browsers

## Examples

### Similar Features

- Avatar upload in chat system
- Document upload in content management
- Image gallery upload flow

### Expected Behavior

```typescript
// Component usage
<UserProfile
  userId="123"
  editable={true}
  onImageUpload={(file) => handleUpload(file)}
/>

// Upload flow
1. User clicks upload button
2. File picker opens
3. Image preview shown
4. Crop/adjust if needed
5. Confirm upload
6. Progress indicator shown
7. Success confirmation
```

### Edge Cases

- Upload interruption handling
- Network failure recovery
- Invalid file handling
- Concurrent upload attempts
- Storage quota exceeded

## Implementation Notes

### API Changes

```typescript
interface UserProfileProps {
  // ... existing props
  onImageUpload?: (file: File) => Promise<void>;
  imageUploadProgress?: number;
}
```

### New Components Needed

- `ImageUploader.tsx`
- `ImageCropper.tsx`
- `UploadProgress.tsx`

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for file validation
- Integration tests for upload flow
- E2E tests for full upload process
- Mobile device testing
- Error scenario coverage
