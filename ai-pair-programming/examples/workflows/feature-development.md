# AI Pair Programming Workflow: Feature Development

## Example: Adding User Profile Image Upload

### Phase 1: Planning & Context

#### 1. Initial Request to AI

```
I need to add image upload capability to the UserProfile component.
Can you help me plan the implementation?
```

#### 2. Context Gathering

```
AI: I'll help analyze the requirements. First, I'll need to understand:
- Current UserProfile implementation
- Existing image handling
- Storage requirements
- Security constraints

Let me check the relevant files...
```

#### 3. Requirements Clarification

```
AI: Based on the codebase:
- UserProfile currently only displays images
- We'll need to add upload capability
- Should integrate with existing S3 storage
- Must maintain TypeScript types

Would you like me to outline the implementation steps?
```

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 1. Component Structure

```
USER: Yes, let's start with the component structure.

AI: I'll create an ImageUploader component first:
- File input handling
- Image preview
- Upload progress
- Error handling
```

#### 2. Iterative Development

```
AI: Here's the basic ImageUploader. Let's review and refine:
[Code implementation]

USER: Looks good, but we need error handling for large files.

AI: I'll add size validation and error messaging:
[Updated code]
```

#### 3. Integration

```
AI: Now let's integrate with UserProfile:
- Add upload handler
- Update types
- Connect to S3 service
[Integration code]
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement

#### 1. Test Implementation

```
USER: Can you help with test cases?

AI: I'll create tests for:
- File validation
- Upload flow
- Error scenarios
[Test code]
```

#### 2. Edge Cases

```
AI: Let's handle these edge cases:
- Upload interruption
- Network failures
- Invalid files
[Edge case handling]
```

#### 3. Documentation

```
AI: I'll update the documentation:
- Component usage
- Props interface
- Example code
[Documentation updates]
```

### Phase 4: Review & Optimization

#### 1. Code Review

```
AI: Let's review the implementation:
- Type safety ✓
- Error handling ✓
- Performance ✓
- Security ✓
```

#### 2. Optimization

```
USER: Can we improve the upload performance?

AI: Yes, let's add:
- Image compression
- Chunked uploads
- Progress tracking
[Optimization code]
```

#### 3. Final Documentation

```
AI: I'll add implementation notes:
- Architecture decisions
- Performance considerations
- Security measures
[Final documentation]
```
