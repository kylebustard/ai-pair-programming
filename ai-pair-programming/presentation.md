### 3. Optimizing for AI Discoverability (5 minutes)

#### Documentation Patterns

1. YAML Frontmatter

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Component Name
   description: Brief purpose
   category: UI | Auth | Data
   status: Stable | Beta
   lastUpdated: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   ```

2. Directory Structure
   ```
   project/
   ├── README.md           # Project overview
   ├── .aiindex.yaml      # AI-specific metadata
   └── src/
       ├── components/    # Each with README
       └── patterns/      # Common patterns
   ```

#### Code Organization

1. Component Documentation

   ```typescript
   /**
    * @ai-context Auth flow handling
    * @related-components [AuthForm, Profile]
    * @state-management URL state
    */
   ```

2. Type Documentation
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @ai-pattern Auth state
    * @validation email format
    */
   type AuthState = {
     email: string;
     step: "init" | "verify";
   };
   ```

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. Documentation Strategy

   - Keep docs close to code
   - Use explicit relationships
   - Document "why" over "what"
   - Include practical examples

2. Cross-Referencing

   - Link related components
   - Reference architecture decisions
   - Map dependencies
   - Maintain documentation

3. Maintenance Best Practices
   - Regular metadata reviews
   - Update relationship maps
   - Keep examples current
   - Remove obsolete patterns
